# A 𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌 is a 𝒅𝒊𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉 G with vertices V and edges E combined with a function c, which assigns each edge 
  e ∈ E a non-negative integer value, the capacity of e. 
  Such a network is called a 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘 𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌, if we additionally label two vertices, one as 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆 and one as 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒌.

# A 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘 in a flow network is function f, that again assigns each edge e a non-negative integer value, namely the
  flow. The function has to fulfill the following two conditions:
  • The flow of an edge cannot exceed the capacity.
  • And the sum of the incoming flow of a vertex u has to be equal to the sum of the outgoing flow of u except 
    in the source and sink vertices. The source vertex s only has an outgoing flow, and the sink vertex t has 
    only incoming flow. And the sum of outflow of source must be = sum of inflow of sink.

# Or we can say 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘 is the exact amount of material flowing through the edge.
# While 𝒄𝒂𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒚 is the maximum amount of material that can flow through the edge.

# 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒅𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝒄𝒂𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒚 = capacity - flow (for an edge).
# 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒆 𝒆𝒅𝒈𝒆 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒅𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝒄𝒂𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒚 = • Remember "reverse edge is always IMAGINARY" i.e. for edge (u, v), we
  assume an imaginary reverse edge (v, u) (even if there actually exists an edge from (v, u) in the graph, we don't 
  take the graph's original (v, u) edge as reverse edge, but assume some imaginary edge (v, u) as reverse edge.

  • Residual capacity of reverse edge = capacity of reverse edge - flow in reverse edge.
  • If flow of edge (u, v) = x, then flow of reverse edge (v, u) is taken as -x.
  • Capacity of reverse edge (v, u) is taken as 0.

# 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒅𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉 = A graph represented with the help of it's residual edges.

# So basically Residual capacity signifies "How much still can be send through the the pipe(edge)".
  And Reverse residual capacity signifies "By how much amount you can decrease the flow through the pipe(edge)".

# 𝑨𝒖𝒈𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒑𝒂𝒕𝒉 = A path from source to sink such that the residual capacity on every edge of the path > 0.

# 𝑴𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 𝑭𝒍𝒐𝒘 = It is defined as the maximum amount of flow that the network would allow to flow from source 
                   to sink.

# 2 algorithms to find out Maximum flow in a network(There are more):
  • Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
  • Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
