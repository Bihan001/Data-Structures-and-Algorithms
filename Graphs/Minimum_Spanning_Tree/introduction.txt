# Spanning Tree - it is a subset of Graph G (a tree), which has 𝑨𝑳𝑳 the vertices covered with 𝑴𝑰𝑵𝑰𝑴𝑼𝑴 
                  possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected (as it is a tree).

# By the above definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least 
  one spanning tree.

# A complete undirected graph can have maximum n⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾ number of spanning trees, where n is the number of nodes.

# GENERAL PROPERTIES OF SPANNING TREE ⟶
  • A connected graph G can have more than one spanning tree.
  • All possible spanning trees of graph G, have the same number of edges and vertices.
  • The spanning tree does not have any cycle (loops).
  • Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected, i.e. the spanning tree is 
    𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 (i.e. if the spanning tree has 'n' vertices then it will have exactly (n-1) edges).
  • Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a circuit or loop, i.e. the spanning tree is 𝒎𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒂𝒄𝒚𝒄𝒍𝒊𝒄.

# MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES OF SPANNING TREE ⟶
  • Spanning tree has n-1 edges, where n is the number of nodes (vertices).
  • From a complete undirected graph graph, by removing maximum (e - n + 1) edges, we can construct a spanning tree.
  • A complete undirected graph can have maximum n⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾ number of spanning trees.

# APPLICATION OF SPANNING TREE ⟶
  • Spanning tree is basically used to find a minimum path to connect all nodes in a graph.
    Common application of spanning trees are −
    1. Civil Network Planning
    2. Computer Network Routing Protocol
    3. Cluster Analysis

# MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (MST) ⟶
  • In a WEIGHTED graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has 𝑴𝑰𝑵𝑰𝑴𝑼𝑴 weight than all other 
    spanning trees of the same graph. 
  • In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance, congestion, traffic load or any arbitrary
    value denoted to the edges.
  • Minimum spanning tree may or may not be unique.
    If the weight assign for all the edges of graph are unique, then minimum spanning tree will be unique.
    Otherwise there can be many minimum spanning tree.

# Algorithms used for finding MST for UG ⟶

  • Prim's Algorithm

# MAXIMUM SPANNING TREE ⟶ It is a spanning tree with weight greater than or equal to the weight of every other
  spanning tree. 
  Such a tree can be found with algorithms such as Prim's or Kruskal's after multiplying the edge weights by -1
  and solving the MST problem on the new graph.
