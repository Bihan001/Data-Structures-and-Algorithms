# Important points:
  Use BFS when no weights are associated with edges in the graph.
  Use Dijkstra when +ve weights are associated with edges in the graph.
  Use Bellman-Ford when -ve weights and -ve cycles associated with edges in the graph.

# Time complexities:
  BFS: O(V+E)
  Dijkstra: O(V.log(E))
  Bellman-Ford: O(V.E)
  Floyd-Warshall: O(V^3)
